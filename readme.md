**Summary**
This repository is about my portfolio on roblox scripting. Please refer to my project portfolio below.



* **A script for a Roblox Tycoon project**  
My involvement in this project is to add a **Roblox script** that will be triggered when a player purchases a  developer product. In this case, the player can purchase and use it to kill, kick, steal, etc.

* **A script for a shop select and buying system**  
In this project, I made a script that checks if the player has selected an item and also verifies if the player has enough water (the currency in the game) before the player receives the item.

* **Sample Code for Data Storing**  
In this project, I created a script that adds a water attribute to the player and saves it when the player leaves the game. The water attribute is also loaded in the player when the player joins the game.

I developed my Plant game independently. This game, I believe, will serve as a good testament to my abilities. Also, it’s worth mentioning that I finished this game a few months ago, and since then, my experience has substantially increased. I’m currently working on a game about a desert as a side project. It’s not intended for publication, but rather for educational purposes. If you’re interested, feel free to take a look at my code.
