Greetings, my name is Paul Andrei Jison. I encountered tasks such as data saving, developer product purchase, shop purchasing, and many more during my 10 months of experience as a Roblox scripter. Although I have worked on group projects in the past, I am still expanding my knowledge of scripting.

I developed this game independently. This file, I believe, will serve as a good testament to my abilities. Also, itâ€™s worth mentioning that I created this game a few months ago, and since then, my experience has substantially increased.
**Please note that the game file is attached to this repository**
